* CSS can be internal, inline, and external
* External is most common form
* External CSS files are linked to in the header section just like a JS file
* Use a `selector` (like `p`) with declarations in between `{}`
* You can have a list of selectors that share the same set of declarations
* CSS comments are the same as HTML comments `<!-- comment -->`
* ID Attributes are used once
* IDs start with a `#`
* Classes are styles that are used again and again
* Classes start with a `.` instead of a `#`
* Block elements sthat start on a new line; examples - p, ul, li, etc.
* `<div>` a block that contains information
* `<span>` is a chunk of text that can be modified differently from the surrounding text
* `<span>` does not go to a new line
